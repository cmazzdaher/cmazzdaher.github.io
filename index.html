								<b style="font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Stellar Multiplicity and Stellar Parameters in APOGEE</b><br>Within the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey, I and my colleagues have looked at numerous sets of parameters and their relation to stellar multiplicity. We do this by using the sample's distribution of maximum shifts in the radial velocities (RVs), &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub>, as a proxy for the occurrence of close binaries. This allows us to include stars with 2+ visits, greatly expanding the size of our sample. For reference, out of XXXX stars in APOGEE data release 16, XX% have only 2 visits, YY% have 3, and ZZ% have 4 or more!
								<br><br>I've worked or am working on several sub-projects within this greater topic, including:
								<dl>
									<dt style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>Evolution, Metallicity, and Multiplicity in DR13</i></dt>
  									<dd style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 20px;"> As a star progresses up the red giant branch (RGB), they grow in size, which has implications for very short-period companions. We saw evidence for removal of these short-period systems via trends between &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> and the stars' surface gravity log(g), shown below. We also found an anti-correlation between &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> and [Fe/H]. Our work was published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaa765">The Astrophysical Journal in Feb. 2018</a>.</dd>
