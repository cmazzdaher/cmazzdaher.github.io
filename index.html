								<b style="font-size: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Stellar Multiplicity and Stellar Parameters in APOGEE</b><br>Within the SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 survey, my advisor <a href="https://carlesbadenes.github.io">Carles Badenes</a> and I, alongside our colleagues, have looked at numerous sets of parameters and their relationships with stellar multiplicity. We accomplish this by using the sample's distribution of &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> (maximum shifts in the radial velocities, RVs) as a proxy for the occurrence of close binaries. A star that has a &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> far in excess of what can be explained by RV uncertainties can be presumed to have a short-period companion; with the high-quality spectra from APOGEE, we can study systems with periods up to 10,000 days in this manner. This method only requires that stars have 2+ visits, allowing us to keep the majority of APOGEE's sample. For reference, out of 343,888 stars in APOGEE data release 16 that pass a simple set of quality cuts, 18% have only 2 visits, 34% have 3, and 28% have 4 or more!
								<br><br>I've worked or am working on several sub-projects within this research topic.

									<dt style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><i>Evolution, Metallicity, and Multiplicity in DR13</i></dt>
  									<dd style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 10px;"> As a star progresses up the red giant branch (RGB), it grows in size, which has unfortunate implications for very short-period companions. We saw evidence for attrition of these short-period systems via trends between &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> and the stars' surface gravity log(g), shown below. We also found an anti-correlation between &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> and [Fe/H]. Our work was published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aaa765">The Astrophysical Journal in Feb. 2018</a>, and our anti-correlation was further studied and confirmed in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0d88/meta">Moe, Kratter, and Badenes 2019</a>.</dd>

  									<dd style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 10px;">In this project, we compared an assortment of stellar parameters against the distribution of &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> for a selection of APOGEE DR14 dwarfs/subgiants (log(g)&#8805;3.25). The parameters we considered included effective temperature and several elemental abundances from APOGEE DR14, as well as masses, ages, and parameters related to the stars' galactic orbital motions from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/481/3/4093/5097887">Sanders & Das et al. 2018</a>. The relationships we saw are complex and difficult to characterize without a thorough study, but one set of trends stood out above the rest. The anti-correlation with [Fe/H] was again found, but we also discovered a further anti-correlation with four &alpha; abundances, as shown in the figure below. Our work was published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/499/2/1607/5910510">Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in Dec. 2020</a>.</dd>

  									<dd style="margin-top: 3px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Stars in close binaries suffer the consequences of stellar evolution, but they also experience tidal interactions that can have a number of effects. This can include rotational synchronization, where the orbital period and rotational periods become synchronized. We investigated the relationship between surface gravity log(g), rotation speed <i>v</i>sin(i), and &Delta;RV<sub>max</sub> for HR-selected samples of APOGEE DR14 dwarfs and giants, finding that the extremes of the distributions are well-described by theoretical upper limits derived from a set of simple assumptions that include rotational synchronization. For our cool (T<sub>eff</sub> &#8804; 6200 K) dwarfs, we also used masses and ages from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/481/3/4093/5097887">Sanders & Das et al. 2018</a> catalog to compare with gyrochronology relations from Barnes 2010 (gray lines), as shown in the figure below. We found that the close binary fraction is strongly correlated with <i>v</i>sin(i) (upper panel, blue line), but we also see that close binaries have massively faster rotation speeds for their ages than would be otherwise expected for single stars using gyrochronology. Our work has been submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01100">arXiv:2110.01100</a>).</dd>

								<br style="line-height:1.4;">Diversity enriches science and the departments where scientific research occurs. When possible, I try to take every opportunity to foster diversity.
								<br><br>As an undergraduate at Mississippi State University, I participated in our local chapter of the Society of Physics Students (SPS), and I was vice president for our chapter for the 2015 spring and fall terms. I also attended the 2015 and 2016 APS Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP), which were both incredible experiences for connecting me with other women in the field.
								<br><br>Since then, I have been a member of U. Pitt's Women and Minorities in Physics group, enabling me to participate in discussions of our department's climate and listen to the experiences of other students. I attended two workshops organized by the university in Nov. 2019: the Negotiation and Management Workshop for Women in Sciences, and the Women in Medicine and Science Forum. Both provided informative sessions as well as valuable networking experiences with female students, faculty, and adminstration. Most recently, I and several other volunteers presented several tables' worth of physics demonstrations for attendees at the 2020 CUWiP jointly hosted by U. Pitt and Carnegie Mellon University.
								<br><br>However, the fight for equality and diversity is far from over. I am continually dedicated to supporting the diversification of my department, all the collaborations I have joined, and astronomy at large.
